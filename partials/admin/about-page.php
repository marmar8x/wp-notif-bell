        You can use this plugin to implement user notification system for your WordPress site. With this plugin, different notifications can be sent to different users and roles. This plugin is completely free and open source.
        <br />
        Note that you cannot use this plugin just by installing it, but it must be implemented by another skin or plugin. This plugin is mostly made to help the development of the user notification system and requires an initial preparation by the designer. The least you need to do to get started is to design a section or element to display notifications that are not displayed by default by the plugin.
