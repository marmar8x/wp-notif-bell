        This plugin is designed to implement notifications on your site. As much as possible, I tried to avoid sieving foliage for the plugin. If you do not want to see the pages related to the plugin, get help from the help page.
        <br />
        This plugin is available in beta version. It is normal that parts of the plugin have problems or are not complete.
